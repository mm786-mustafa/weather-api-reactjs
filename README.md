# weather-api-reactjs

Welcome to my Weather App project! This application allows users to get real-time weather updates for any city in the world. It is built using React JS and leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display weather data.

# Features
1) Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches and displays the latest weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2) Dynamic User Interface: A responsive and interactive UI that updates based on user input.
3) State Management: Utilizes React's useState hook for managing the state of the application, including weather data, error handling, and component visibility.
4) Component-Based Architecture: Modular components (Input, Weather, App) for better code organization and reusability.
5) Conditional Rendering: Dynamically renders components and handles user interactions to ensure a smooth user experience.
6) Error Handling: Provides clear feedback if the user inputs an invalid city name.
# Technologies Used
React JS: For building the user interface and managing state.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
CSS: For styling the application to ensure a clean and user-friendly design.
